quote: "The ultimate purpose of psychotherapy is not so much the archaeological exploration of infantile sentiments as it is learning gradually and with much effort to accept our own limits and to carry the weight of suffering on our own shoulders for the rest of our lives. Psychological work, instead of providing liberation from the cause of discomfort, increases it, teaching the person to become adult and, for the first time in his (her) life, actively face the feeling of being alone with his (her) pain and abandoned by the world."

<h2>Individual Therapy</h2>

<p>Individual therapy (sometimes called counselling, psychotherapy, or simply therapy) is a process where you work one-to-one with a trained therapist. This is done in a caring, safe, and confidential space where you can explore your emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours, identify and work through issues in your life that you would like to change, accept, or better understand.</p>

<p>People will be interested in therapy for many different reasons; it may be childhood or adult traumas, dealing with major life transitions, challenges, or life events, or dealing with depression, anxiety, relationship issues or the desire for greater insight and personal growth.</p>

<p>I work one to one with adults either for time limited brief therapy, or as long as several years, in a more depth oriented, attachment focused way, depending on your needs and personal goals.</p>

<h2>What is your first step?</h2>
<p>The first step is to schedule an initial assessment appointment where we can meet each other and I will briefly take your life history and get more detailed information about your presenting issues and reasons for seeking therapy. We can discuss together what your specific needs and goals are for therapy, and I can answer any questions you have about the therapy, fees, confidentiality, cancellations, and what to expect from the therapy.</p>
<p>The first task is always to develop a safe, collaborative and positive working alliance. If at the end of the first session we both feel like we want to work together, we can then decide on a mutually-agreeable time slot for your therapy sessions. I generally work where we meet once a week for 50-minute sessions. However, we can always arrange longer or more frequent sessions, depending on your needs.</p>
<h3>My style of working?</h3>
<p>I work in an integrative and transpersonal way. I may incorporate the use of EMDR, mindfulness, somatic (body/physical) awareness, social/relationship issues, creative and when relevant spiritual and existential aspects in one’s life. I may also make links to one’s own history and childhood when these unresolved issues surface and impact your day to day life. I will do periodic reviews of the therapy and discuss together what you feel is working and useful and review your ongoing goals for therapy.</p>

<h2>Couples Therapy</h2>
<p>Couples therapy is available and useful for any couple (you could be simply dating, be engaged, married, long term-partnered, heterosexual or gay). My main orientation is EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy), which is based on Sue Johnson’s research and understanding of adult attachment and bonding. This way of working can help the couple understand what is happening in their cycles of conflict in their relationship and identify the stuck, repeating patterns and cycles we all get into and help you learn more secure, safe, and compassionate ways of navigating these painful interactions to help create a more secure and loving relationship. This involves developing a deeper understanding of each other’s needs, wants, feelings, and behaviours, and how you each contribute to the dance of conflict, and therefore how you each can contribute to a more positive, secure, and loving dynamic.
EFT Focused couples therapy is a collaborative, structured, and usually short-term approach to working with couples. On occasion it may be useful at some stage in the therapy to meet with each partner once separately, but this would be discussed in advance and mutually agreed.</p>

<h2>Clinical Supervision – group and individual</h2>
<p>As a Consultant Psychologist, Psychotherapist, and EMDR Consultant, I am a registered supervisor with the BPS, and consultant/supervisor with EMDR UK &amp; Ireland. I offer one-to-one, dyad, or group supervision to other therapists; counsellors, psychotherapists, and psychologists.</p>
<p>The main goal of supervision is to foster the supervisee’s professional development, provide support for your clinical work, develop and deepen your skills and ensure client safety.</p>

  <p>Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> to discuss what your personal needs or interests are regarding supervision.</p>
