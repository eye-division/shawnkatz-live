- quote: "People say that what we are all seeking is some meaning to this life. I don't think that that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're really seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our innermost being so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive."

- quote: "The ultimate purpose of psychotherapy is not so much the archaeological exploration of infantile sentiments as it is learning gradually and with much effort to accept our own limits and to carry the weight of suffering on our own shoulders for the rest of our lives. Psychological work, instead of providing liberation from the cause of discomfort, increases it, teaching the person to become adult and, for the first time in his (her) life, actively face the feeling of being alone with his (her) pain and abandoned by the world."
