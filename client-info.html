  "People say that what we are all seeking is some meaning to this life. I don't
  think that that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're really
  seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the
  purely physical plane will have resonances within our innermost being so that
  we actually feel the rapture of being alive."

      <h3><strong>Personal information I collect</strong></h3>
      <p>I collect the following information in order to help me provide psychological therapy to you, receive clinical supervision and consultation, and to maintain my accounts for billing and invoicing.</p>
      <p>Personal details: name, gender, date of birth, relationships; parents, siblings, children, occupation, address, telephone numbers, email address, counselling /therapy history, medical conditions, prescribed medication, emotional &amp; psychological issues, employment, education, and social life details.</p>

      <h3><strong>How I may Process/Share your personal information</strong></h3>
      <p>I have regular supervision/consultation with other therapists, (psychologists, psychotherapists, counsellors, psychiatrists) for my own professional development and the wellbeing of clients. I will discuss personal issues and processes in these consultations. They are also bound by the same rules of confidentiality, code of ethics, and rules of GDPR.</p>
      <h3><strong>Therapeutic Will</strong>: In the case of my death, your name and contact details will be shared with my Therapeutic Executor. This is so you can be contacted if you are still in therapy with me.</h3>
      <h3><strong>Emergencies</strong></h3>
      <p>If I have reason to believe that you intend to harm another person/organisation (eg. terrorism), or yourself, the law may require that I inform an authority without seeking your permission. In such a situation, the law may require that I share your personal information without your knowledge. I would always endeavour to discuss this with you in advance if possible or appropriate. It is also the law that a judge can require the release of clinical notes without your permission, and I would be bound by law to release them. Again I would discuss this with you beforehand should this occur.</p>

      <h3><strong>Paper:</strong> written notes, contact details, personal information, psychometric tests when completed, assessment/history taking notes, occasional email correspondence, and brief therapy process notes.

      <h3><strong>Erasing your Information</strong></h3>
      <p>I keep electronic emails for up to a year, after which time I erase/delete them from my email account. I delete/erase all SMS/text messages each week. When. I am required by law to keep your written notes for up to 7 years after we have completed our work together. After this time has passed, I will shred the written information. I may keep them longer in case you return to therapy in the future so that I have a reference for our work together.</p>
      <h3><strong>You Have the Following Rights:</strong></h3>

      <p>To request your personal information be erased/deleted/shredded. I can decline if the information is needed for me to practice lawfully &amp; competently, or if there is an adverse reason (such as a complaint or legal reason).</p>
      <p><strong><em>A printed copy of this statement will be given to you. We will both sign the printed copy of this statement to indicate our agreement. Continuation of therapy or supervision with me will be understood as acceptance of these terms</em></strong></p>

      <h2><strong>Client statement information</strong></h2>
      <p>Therapy is an investment in yourself. For it to be most effective it requires a 100% commitment, personal integrity and responsibility.</p>
      <p>The following information outlines important agreements regarding entering into therapy.</p>
      <h2>Confidentiality</h2>

In these cases, I have an ethical and legal obligation to report relevant information to the appropriate authorities.</p>

      <h2>Scheduling and Cancellation Policy</h2>

      <p>You can end your therapy at any time, allowing a minimum of 2-3 sessions for closure.<br />A minimum of 2 week notice is required for pre-arranged leave or cancelled sessions. A full fee will be charged for any missed or cancelled sessions with less than 2 weeks prior notice.</p>
