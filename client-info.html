	<h2>CLIENT STATEMENT INFORMATION</h2>

  Therapy is an investment in yourself. For it to be most effective it requires a 100% commitment, personal integrity and responsibility.
The following information outlines important agreements regarding entering into therapy.
Confidentiality:
All information is held strictly confidential unless prior written approval is obtained. The only exceptions to this are circumstances where I believe that you might harm yourself, or where actual harm could come to a person or place, or where child, spousal, or elder abuse is involved. In these cases, I have an ethical and legal obligation to report relevant information to the appropriate authorities.
Payment Policy:
You are responsible for payment at the time of each session unless prior arrangements are made. Payment can be made by bank transfer, check or cash. I will provide you with monthly receipts, and fill out appropriate sections of private insurance forms. Fees are usually increased every 12-18 months, and you will be given 6-8 weeks of prior notice.
Scheduling and Cancellation Policy:
Following our initial assessment consultation we can discuss together whether you wish short or longer term more depth oriented therapy.
You can end your therapy at any time, allowing a minimum of 2-3 sessions for closure.
A minimum of 2 week notice is required for pre-arranged leave or cancelled sessions. A full fee will be charged for any missed or cancelled sessions with less than 2 weeks prior notice.
I take between 6-8 weeks of annual leave and will give you a minimum of 3 weeks advance notification.
You have every reason to receive and expect that I will conduct myself professionally, responsibly and according to the ethical laws, regulations, and code of conduct of the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC), the British Psychological Society (BPS), the UK Council of Psychotherapists (UKCP), EMDR UK & Ireland Association, and European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA), all of which I am a full professional member.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding these statements, I will be glad to discuss them in person.
