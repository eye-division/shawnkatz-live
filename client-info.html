quote: "People say that what we are all seeking is some meaning to this life. I don't think that that's what we're really seeking. I think that what we're really seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our innermost being so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive."

	<h2>Client statement information</h2>

  <p>Therapy is an investment in yourself. For it to be most effective it requires a 100% commitment, personal integrity and responsibility.</p>
  <p>The following information outlines important agreements regarding entering into therapy.</p>

  <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>All information is held strictly confidential unless prior written approval is obtained. The only exceptions to this are circumstances where I believe that you might harm yourself, or where actual harm could come to a person or place, or where child, spousal, or elder abuse is involved. In these cases, I have an ethical and legal obligation to report relevant information to the appropriate authorities.</p>

  <h2>Payment Policy</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for payment at the time of each session unless prior arrangements are made. Payment can be made by bank transfer, check or cash. I will provide you with monthly receipts, and fill out appropriate sections of private insurance forms. Fees are usually increased every 12-18 months, and you will be given 6-8 weeks of prior notice.</p>

  <h2>Scheduling and Cancellation Policy</h2>
  <p>Following our initial assessment consultation we can discuss together whether you wish short or longer term more depth oriented therapy.</p>
  <p>You can end your therapy at any time, allowing a minimum of 2-3 sessions for closure.<br>
  A minimum of 2 week notice is required for pre-arranged leave or cancelled sessions. A full fee will be charged for any missed or cancelled sessions with less than 2 weeks prior notice.</p>
  <p>I take between 6-8 weeks of annual leave and will give you a minimum of 3 weeks advance notification.</p>
  <p>You have every reason to receive and expect that I will conduct myself professionally, responsibly and according to the ethical laws, regulations, and code of conduct of the Health &amp; Care Professions Council (HCPC), the British Psychological Society (BPS), the UK Council of Psychotherapists (UKCP), EMDR UK &amp; Ireland Association, and European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA), all of which I am a full professional member.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding these statements, I will be glad to discuss them in person, or <a href="/contact">contact me</a> via this website.</p>
